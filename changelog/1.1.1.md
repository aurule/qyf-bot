# Changelog for qyf-bot v1.1.1

## Added

* Commands with a game argument now match partial game names. Affected commands are `/list-quotes`, `/rand-quote`, `/quote`, and `/set-default-game`.
* Log command calls

## Changed

* Made self-quoting look less silly. Instead of "@reporter quoted @reporter", commands now say "@repoter quoted themself"
* Only show All Games option when more than one game is configured
* Improved handling of new command data during deployment

## Removed

* Removed standalone select menu handling
* Got rid of guild-specific commands

## Fixed

* Quoting from the context menu now correctly notes the user who recorded the quote
* Output of `/list-quotes` no longer has empty pages at the end
