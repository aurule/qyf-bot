# Changelog for qyf-bot v1.0.0-rc.2

## Added

* `/qyf-help` now shows which commands can be used in DMs
* qyf-bot now remembers which servers you've made quotes in. This will allow more commands to be used in DMs in the future.

## Changed

* The `/append-quote` command can be used in DMs
* Commands can have more complex permissions in the backend, which opens up granular access control for server owners in the future.

## Fixed

* Fixed rare case where an error message would not be displayed after selecting a game
* Fixed game selection error when quoting in a channel with no default game
* Fixed a crash in some commands when the server ID is invalid
* Multiple fixes to game selection affecting `/set-default-game`, `/update-game`, `/list-quotes`, `/rand-quote`, and `/quote`
    - Game selection arguments now ignore capitalization when showing suggestions
    - Game selections no longer require you to pick from the autocomplete list. Previously, these commands would fail with an error if you typed out the full name of a game instead of selecting one of the presented options
    - Game selection now works properly on phones
